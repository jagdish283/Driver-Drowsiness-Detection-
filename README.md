# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Haar Cascade

## Overview

This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using Haar Cascade for facial feature detection. The system aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's face and alerting them in case of detected drowsiness.

## Features

- Real-time facial feature detection using Haar Cascade.
- Driver drowsiness detection based on eye closure and head movement.
- Alerts through visual and audible cues.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
